# Synology iCloud Photo Sync
A native Synology DSM 7.2 package that automatically mirrors your iCloud photo library to your NAS — so your memories live on storage you own, not just on Apple's servers.
Runs as a proper DSM app with its own tile, settings UI, scheduler daemon, and DSM notifications. No Docker, no cron hacks, no SSH fiddling.

Built with the [SynoCommunity/spksrc](https://github.com/SynoCommunity/spksrc) cross-compilation framework.

## Features

- **iCloud Photostream, Albums & Shared Libraries** — incremental sync with deduplication via hardlinks
- **Multi-account** — several Apple IDs side by side, each with its own settings
- **Parallel downloads** — 1/2/4/8 configurable per account
- **Folder structure** — year / year-month / year-month-day / flat
- **HEIC / JPG conversion** — keep originals, convert, or both
- **Apple 2FA** via trusted-device push or SMS fallback
- **Native DSM UI** — built with SYNO.ux components
- **Multi-language** — English and German
- **Unprivileged** — runs as `iCloudPhotoSync`, not root

## Prebuild Releases

You always find the latest version under releases:

[https://github.com/Euphonique/iCloudPhotoSync/releases/latest](https://github.com/Euphonique/iCloudPhotoSync/releases/latest)

## Building

### Standalone build (recommended)

No spksrc checkout required — just run the included build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

The resulting `.spk` file is created in the project root (e.g. `iCloudPhotoSync-1.4.4.spk`).

### Building with spksrc

Alternatively, build via the full [spksrc](https://github.com/SynoCommunity/spksrc) cross-compilation framework:

1. Clone spksrc and set up the build environment (Docker recommended):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SynoCommunity/spksrc.git
   cd spksrc
   docker build -t spksrc .
   ```

2. Copy or symlink the package directory into your spksrc checkout:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/iCloudPhotoSync-spksrc/spk/icloudphotosync spk/
   ```

3. Build:
   ```bash
   cd spk/icloudphotosync
   make arch-x64-7.2
   ```

The resulting `.spk` files land in `packages/`.

## Requirements

- Synology DSM **7.2** or newer
- Python 3.8+ (provided by spksrc cross/python311 dependency)
- An Apple ID with 2FA enabled
- **iCloud Advanced Data Protection (ADP) must be disabled** for iCloud Photos

## Known limitations

### iCloud Advanced Data Protection (ADP)

If you have ADP enabled, this app cannot access your iCloud Photos. ADP encrypts photos end-to-end so only trusted Apple devices hold decryption keys.

**Workarounds:**
1. Disable ADP: *Settings -> Apple ID -> iCloud -> Advanced Data Protection -> Turn Off*
2. Enable temporary web access at [icloud.com](https://icloud.com) (grants ~1 hour API access)

### Shared Albums (legacy)

Sadly had to remove the Shared Albums feature from Settings, Albums tab, and sync engine. Legacy Shared Albums use a separate Apple API (sharedstreams.icloud.com) that is not accessible via CloudKit. Use the iCloud Shared Library (iOS 16+) feature instead.

## Privacy & security

- Apple password is **never stored permanently** — it is only held temporarily during the 2FA handshake, encrypted with PBKDF2-derived keys and HMAC-authenticated, and kept in RAM only (`/dev/shm`). It is discarded immediately after authentication completes.
- Session cookies stored under `/var/packages/icloudphotosync/var/accounts/{id}/session/` with restrictive file permissions (owner-only)
- All API endpoints require a valid DSM session and CSRF token
- No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home
